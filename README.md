## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Brainy**

Simply visit the [Brainy Project](https://brainy.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Brainy will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Brainy.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## Development Setup

This project uses a proxy configuration to avoid CORS issues during development.

### Environment Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your own credentials in `.env`:
   - Get a Supabase account and project at https://supabase.com
   - Add your database URL and Supabase keys
   - Generate secure random strings for JWT secrets
   
3. **Never commit the `.env` file** - it's already in `.gitignore`

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev:full
```
This will start both frontend (port 8080) and backend (port 5000) simultaneously.

### Manual Start
Start backend:
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

Start frontend (in another terminal):
```bash
npm run dev
```

### API Configuration
- Frontend: http://localhost:8080 (with API proxy to backend)
- Backend: http://localhost:5000
- API calls use relative URLs (/api/auth) which are proxied automatically

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
